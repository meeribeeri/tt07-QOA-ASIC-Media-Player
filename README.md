# QOA ASIC Media Player
This program allows the playing of a QOA file when connected to an ASIC designed to decode the QOA file

The code for emulating the necessary decoder on a Raspberri Pi can be found [here](https://github.com/28add11/tt07_qoa_decode).

The decoder code itself can be found [here](https://github.com/28add11/tt07_qoa_decode).
